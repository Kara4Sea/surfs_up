# Surfs Up

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to understand Oahu temperature trends at opposite ends of the calendar, in June and December. This will help the client determine if a surf and ice cream shop could be expected to have sustainable business throughout the year.

## Results
* The mean temperature in June and December are similar. The mean for June is 74.9 and the mean for December is 71.0, for a difference of 3.9 degrees. Since the mean temperatures are similar, this is one piece in demonstrating that temperature would not be a factor in sustaining business throughout the year.
* There is more variance in minimum temperatures for June and December. In June the minimum temperature is 64 degrees and in December it is 56 degrees, for a difference of 8 degrees. The difference, although larger than the mean, is not as significant. The minimum temperature could be pulled from any time of day, such as early-mornings or late-evenings when the sun is down. These are not times we can expect the surf shop to be open and therefore this shouldn't have an impact to the business.
* The maximum temperatures in June and December are the most similar. In June the maximum temperature is 85 degrees and in December it is 83 degrees, for a difference of only 2 degrees. This bodes well to demonstrate that temperature should have consistency throughout the year, and therefore would lead to a sustainable year-round business.

## Summary
Overall temperature results for June and December  show there is little temperature variance throughout the year. This is good news, as it is promising in predicting a sustainable year-round business model.

I recommend running two additional queries to fully vet weather impact to the surf shop experiencing sustainable business throughout the year. The first would be a breakdown of temperature limited to store business hours in June and December. This would test the earlier theory that minimum temperatures are most likely from early morning and late evening when the sun is down, and therefore would not impact business during open hours. The second query I recommend would include finding additional data regarding wave height measurements throughout the year. This would help establish if some times of year would be more popular with surfers than others.
